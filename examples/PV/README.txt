Moosh for photovoltaics

Case inspired by J. Appl. Phys. 111, 083102 (2012), available here:

but the parameters for the amorphous silicon being actually confidential (sigh)
standards parameters that seem to agree quite well are used here. Plus here a realistic back-reflector (silver) is used.

Beam shows a picture of the resonance in the active layer for normal incidence. 
Spectrum shows the absorption spectrum, as does Photo, in addition to computing the short-circuit current for the structure.
