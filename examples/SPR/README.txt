			Surface Plasmon Resonance


Run Angular or Spectrum to compute the reflection coefficient (and absorption, eventually) for a structure witha BK7 prism, on which a gold layer (thickness 38 nm) is deposited (using a 4 nm chromium layer). Spectrum shows the absorption in the two layers, showing how important a role the chromium layer can play.

Beam will show you for a 10-wavelength wide beam that the excitation of the surface plasmon does not enlarge so much the reflected beam, allowing quite accurate SPR imaging. 

Guidedmodes will show you that there are actually two guided modes in the structure. The lower effective index one, that is actually leaky and that can thus be excited using the prism and a higher index one corresponding to a surface plasmon at the interface between BK7 and gold that is very lossy because of the chromium.
